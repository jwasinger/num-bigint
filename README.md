Big integer types for Rust, `BigInt` and `BigUint`.

> **Warning** This is a fork of [`rust-num/num-bigint`](https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint) with a focus on providing functionality, needed to implement cryptographic operations.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
num-bigint-dig = "0.2"
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate num_bigint_dig as num_bigint;
```

## Features

The `std` crate feature is mandatory and enabled by default.  If you depend on
`num-bigint` with `default-features = false`, you must manually enable the
`std` feature yourself.  In the future, we hope to support `#![no_std]` with
the `alloc` crate when `std` is not enabled.

Implementations for `i128` and `u128` are only available with Rust 1.26 and
later.  The build script automatically detects this, but you can make it
mandatory by enabling the `i128` crate feature.

The `prime` feature gate enables algorithms and support for dealing with large primes.

## Releases

Release notes are available in [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

## Compatibility

The `num-bigint` crate is tested for rustc 1.15 and greater.

## Alternatives

While `num-bigint` strives for good performance in pure Rust code, other
crates may offer better performance with different trade-offs.  The following
table offers a brief comparison to a few alternatives.
